/*
 * A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener commonly used in diet soda pop will cause 
 * death in laboratory mice.  A friend of yours is desperate to lose weight but cannot give up soda pop.  
 * Your friend wants to know how much diet soda pop it is possible to drink without dying as a result.  

Write a program to supply the answer. The program has no input but does have defined constants for the following 
items: the amount of artificial sweetener needed to kill a mouse, the weight of the mouse, the starting weight of 
the dieter, and the desired weight of the dieter. To ensure the safety of your friend, be sure the program uses the 
weight at which the dieter will stop dieting, rather than the dieterâ€™s current weight, to calculate how much soda pop 
the dieter can safely drink. You may use any reasonable values for these defined constants. Assume that diet soda 
contains 1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener. Use another named constant for this fraction.

You may want to express the percent as the double value 0.001. (If your program turns out not to use a 
defined constant, you may remove that defined constant from your program.)
